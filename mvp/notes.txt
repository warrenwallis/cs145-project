1. Where to get data from
    - Alpha Vantage can be used for historical and technical indicator data
        - limited by how many free API calls we can make
        - can be used for both python and nodejs
    - Yahoo Finance is free but is limited and will probably only used for historical data
        - python
    - IEX Cloud seems to be good for technical indicators
        - best part: free * insert eagle noises *
2. What data to use in ML model
    - technical idicators
        - current for the day
    - historical data
        - open
        - close
        - close > open
3. What ML model to choose
    - logistic regression
        - our data is continuous
        - remember that we want to focus on classifying buy or sell, for now
    - neural networks
        - there is a link in the README with a good example of using Keras
    - 
4. Other things to ponder about
    - do we do current technical indicator along with historical range
    - do we do all technical indicators along with historical data for a given historical range
    - do we also juxtapose our stock data with the broader marker
