# CS 145 Final Project

## Notes

1. Using Alpha Vantage and yfinance to get data
2. Using sklearn for ml models: logistic regression, decision tree, LSTM

## Work Flow

### Logistic Regression

Experiment 1:
  - train on yesterday's data
  - predict today based on yesterday

Experiment 2:
  - train on yester's data with more parameters
  - predict today based on yesterday

NOTES:
  - experiment 1 and 2 should be used for comparison of models

### LSTM

NOTES:
  - use to show prediction of prices
  - possibly use as a baseline depending on error
